## Abstract
This repository contains code and additional resources supporting our study on the clustering algorithms for analyzing longitudinal associations between Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and stroke mortality.

## 1. Data
The datasets used in this study are publicly accessible at:
- [AHRQ](https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/index.html)
- [CDC Atlas](https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/atlas/index.htm)

## 2. Code Structure
### Overview
Our study introduces a novel clustering algorithm to analyze longitudinal associations between SDOH and stroke mortality across US counties.

### Reproducibility
- The folder **`grpreg2`**: Contains code for algorithmic optimization.
- The folder **`simu`**: Contains code for simulation experiments.
- The folder **`realdata`**: Contains code for analyzing the real data.
